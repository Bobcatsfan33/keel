"""Worker leasing.

A run is fully described by its event log, so "parked" and "crashed" are
indistinguishable to a fresh worker: it folds the log, sees the frontier, and
continues. Leasing is the cooperative lock that keeps *two* workers from advancing
the same run at once. Combined with the store's ``(run_id, seq)`` uniqueness, even a
brief double-lease during a partition cannot corrupt the log — the loser's append
collides on seq and is rejected.

The protocol has an in-memory implementation (single-process clusters / tests) and a
Postgres advisory-lock implementation (`substrate.store.postgres`) for real
multi-node deployments. Both sit behind ``LeaseManager`` so the worker loop is
identical against either.
