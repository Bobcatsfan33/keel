"""Leased worker loop.

Wraps the Phase-1 executor (via the Runner) with lease acquisition + heartbeating so
the *same* executor code runs unmodified in an N-worker cluster. A worker pulls a run
id from the scheduler, acquires its lease, resumes it (fold -> frontier -> run), and
releases. If the worker dies mid-run its lease expires and another worker steals the
run and resumes from the frontier — completed steps are never re-run, hence never
re-billed.
