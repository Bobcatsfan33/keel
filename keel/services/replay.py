"""Time-travel replay (P2-6).

Every nondeterministic input was recorded through an L1 port, so a run can be
re-driven exactly. Two modes:

  * ``replay_recorded`` — feed the recorded timestamps, ids, and model/tool outputs
    back through the Replay* ports and re-run the executor. The emitted log is
    *byte-identical* to the original (any divergence means a nondeterminism leak).
  * ``replay_patched`` — seed the run up to ``from_step`` from the recorded log
    (optionally overwriting that step's output), then execute everything downstream
    LIVE. Upstream is unchanged; divergence is confined to the patched point and its
    descendants — the substrate for "what-if" debugging and for eval cases (Phase 4).

This driver lives in L3 because it assembles handlers; the pure log-level helpers
(``verify_recorded_replay``, ``diff_runs``) stay in ``executor.replay`` (L2).
